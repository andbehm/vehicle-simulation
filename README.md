# AI Vehicle Simulation for High School Students

## Introduction

This repository contains a vehicle simulation designed to introduce high school students to the concepts of Artificial Intelligence (AI), Deep Learning, and Neural Networks through a motivating and interactive example of autonomous driving.

The core idea is a simple game where a vehicle, moving at a constant speed, must navigate a parcour without hitting walls.

**Manual Driving Mode:**
* The player controls the vehicle using the **left and right arrow keys**.
* The objective is to keep the vehicle moving and avoid collisions with the walls.
* Reaching the **green square** signifies the end of a successful run.
* Upon reaching the green square, the simulation saves a history of telemetric data to a CSV file. This data is crucial for training the AI model.
* Telemetric data is recorded 5 times per second and includes:
    * Distance to the nearest wall directly in front.
    * Distance to the nearest wall at a 30-degree angle to the left.
    * Distance to the nearest wall at a 60-degree angle to the left.
    * Distance to the nearest wall at a 30-degree angle to the right.
    * Distance to the nearest wall at a 60-degree angle to the right.

**AI Model & Autonomous Mode:**
* The collected telemetric data is used to train a neural network.
* The basic neural network architecture consists of:
    * An input layer with 5 nodes (corresponding to the 5 distance sensors).
    * A hidden layer with a configurable number of nodes (typically between 4 and 32).
    * An output layer with 3 nodes, predicting the vehicle's next action: go straight, turn left, or turn right.
* The simulation can be switched to **autonomous mode**, where the trained AI model makes driving decisions based on the live telemetric data.
* In autonomous mode, the top-right corner of the simulation displays the current telemetric data and the model's predicted action.
* Interestingly, the model is *not* explicitly trained on reaching the green square; its sole objective, learned from the training data, is to avoid hitting walls.
* It was discovered that a simple feed-forward neural network was not always sufficient for robust navigation. An **RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)-based model**, utilizing a sequence of 10 previous telemetric readings, significantly improved performance.

## How to Use the Python Scripts

Make sure you have Python installed, along with the necessary libraries (see `requirements.txt`).

1.  **`parcour_sim_auto.py`**:
    * **Purpose:** Starts the vehicle simulation game using the standard feed-forward neural network model.
    * **Usage:** `python parcour_sim_auto.py`
    * **Parameters:** None required.
    * **Details:** The script includes two pre-defined parcours, `layout1_walls` and `layout2_walls` (currently identical for demonstration purposes). You can switch between manual and autonomous mode within the simulation. Data from successful manual runs is saved to CSV files.

2.  **`parcour_sim_auto_rnn.py`**:
    * **Purpose:** Starts the vehicle simulation game using the RNN-based model.
    * **Usage:** `python parcour_sim_auto_rnn.py`
    * **Parameters:** None required.
    * **Details:** Similar to `parcour_sim_auto.py` but utilizes the more advanced RNN model for autonomous driving.

3.  **`train_model.py`**:
    * **Purpose:** Trains the standard feed-forward neural network model.
    * **Usage:** `python train_model.py`
    * **Parameters:** None required.
    * **Details:** This script will automatically find and read all `.csv` files (containing telemetric data from manual runs) in the current directory to train the model. The trained model is typically saved as `vehicle_steering_model.keras` (or a similar name).

4.  **`train_model_rnn.py`**:
    * **Purpose:** Trains the RNN-based model.
    * **Usage:** `python train_model_rnn.py`
    * **Parameters:** None required.
    * **Details:** Similar to `train_model.py`, but it trains the RNN model, typically saving it with a name like `vehicle_steering_model_rnn.keras`. It expects the CSV data to be suitable for sequence-based learning.

5.  **`keras_debug.py`**:
    * **Purpose:** A utility script to inspect the predictions of a trained Keras model for a given set of input telemetric data. This is useful for understanding how the model responds to specific sensor readings.
    * **Usage:** `python keras_debug.py <model_file.keras> "<input_data>"`
    * **Example:** `python keras_debug.py vehicle_steering_model4.keras "110.929,50.779,39.225,288.914,98.336"`
    * **Parameters:**
        * `<model_file.keras>`: The path to the saved Keras model file.
        * `<input_data>`: A comma-separated string of 5 floating-point numbers representing the telemetric data (distances forward, left 30째, left 60째, right 30째, right 60째). **Ensure the input data is enclosed in quotes.**

## Potential Todos & Future Enhancements

* **Read Parcour Layout from File(s):** Allow parcours to be defined in external files (e.g., JSON, CSV, or a custom format) instead of being hardcoded.
* **Parcour Layout Editor:** Create a simple graphical tool or interface to design and save new parcours.
* **Switch to PyTorch:** Explore migrating the model training and inference code from TensorFlow/Keras to PyTorch as an alternative deep learning framework.
* **More Sophisticated Sensor Data:** Include other sensor types (e.g., vehicle's own speed if it becomes variable, angle to the green square).
* **Advanced AI Techniques:** Experiment with Reinforcement Learning (e.g., Q-learning, Deep Q-Networks) where the agent learns by trial and error directly within the simulation.
* **Improved Graphics & UI:** Enhance the visual appeal and user interface of the simulation.
